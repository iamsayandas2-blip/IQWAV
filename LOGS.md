2026-09-03 — Estimation Phase 2B: occupied-bandwidth estimation implemented and verified

### Implementation

Added a second primitive under the estimation subsystem:

- `src/iqwav/estimation/bandwidth.py`

Modified:

- `src/iqwav/estimation/__init__.py` (export the new public API)

Public API:

- `estimate_occupied_bandwidth(samples, sample_rate, percent_power=99.0) -> OccupiedBandwidthEstimate`
- `OccupiedBandwidthEstimate` (frozen dataclass): `bandwidth_hz`,
  `lower_frequency_hz`, `upper_frequency_hz`, `percent_power`

Reuses the existing `iqwav.dsp.magnitude_spectrum` FFT utility rather than
duplicating FFT logic; the estimator is a higher-level interpretation layer
over that spectrum, in the same style as `estimate_peak_frequency`.

Definition used: **cumulative-power, bin-based occupied bandwidth.** The
smallest contiguous run of FFT bins whose summed power reaches
`percent_power` percent of the total measured spectral power is located via
an exact two-pointer minimum-window search (correct because bin powers are
non-negative). Each bin of width `resolution_hz = sample_rate / N` is
treated as covering `[bin_freq - resolution_hz/2, bin_freq + resolution_hz/2)`;
the reported edges are the outer edges of the first/last included bin, so
`bandwidth_hz` is `(bins in the run) * resolution_hz` except where clamped
at the real-signal boundaries described below.

Behavior:

- Complex IQ input: full two-sided spectrum, bins ordered ascending from
  approximately `-sample_rate/2` to `+sample_rate/2`; a returned interval
  may include negative frequencies, DC, positive frequencies, or any mix.
  Mirror-image tones at `+f`/`-f` are independent physical content and are
  **not** folded together.
- Real-valued input: the FFT spectrum is conjugate-symmetric, so `+f` and
  `-f` bins represent the *same* physical component. These are folded onto
  the non-negative axis before the search (`power[+k] + power[-k]` for
  `0 < k < N//2`; DC and, for even `N`, Nyquist are self-conjugate and used
  unmodified). Folded total power equals the original two-sided total, so
  no energy is discarded or double-counted. Boundaries are clamped to
  `[0, sample_rate/2]`.
- `percent_power` is monotonic: a larger value can never produce a smaller
  bandwidth for the same signal (proven by the two-pointer search: any
  window satisfying a higher power threshold also satisfies a lower one).
- Constant (including all-zero) input raises `ValueError` rather than
  fabricating a bandwidth, since a DC-only signal has no meaningful
  occupied bandwidth under this definition.
- Requires `sample_rate` positive and finite, `percent_power` finite and
  in `(0, 100]`, and at least 4 samples.

This is explicitly a cumulative-power bin-based estimator, not a
noise-floor-aware bandwidth estimator and not an automatic RF
signal-activity detector: it does not separate signal power from noise
power and does not decide whether a signal is present. It is not a
general-purpose blind RF bandwidth estimator.

### Tests

Added:

- `tests/unit/test_bandwidth_estimation.py`

Focused estimation tests: `36 passed`.

Complete project test suite: `352 passed` (316 baseline + 36 new, zero
regressions).

Coverage includes a narrowband on-bin complex tone, two separated complex
tones (including a much weaker second tone at high `percent_power`),
broadband/noise-like signals versus a tone-plus-moderate-noise case,
monotonicity of bandwidth in `percent_power` across a full sweep including
100%, real-valued input (including near-Nyquist and pure-Nyquist-tone
folding correctness), positive/negative complex-frequency content shown
not to cancel or fold, even and odd sample counts for both real and
complex input, DC- and Nyquist-adjacent edge cases, and the full set of
invalid inputs (bad sample rate, empty/too-few/non-1D/non-finite samples,
zero/constant signals, and invalid `percent_power`).

### Next

Per milestone scope, stopping after Phase 2B. CFO, SNR, noise-floor
estimation, activity detection, AMR, synchronization, modulation
classification, baud-rate estimation, FEC, framing, and GUI work remain
deferred to later milestones.


2026-09-02 — Estimation Phase 2A: spectral peak frequency estimation implemented and verified

### Implementation

Added the first primitive under the previously-reserved estimation subsystem:

- `src/iqwav/estimation/spectral.py`
- `src/iqwav/estimation/__init__.py`

Public API:

- `estimate_peak_frequency(samples, fs, *, refine=True) -> PeakFrequencyEstimate`
- `PeakFrequencyEstimate` (frozen dataclass): `frequency_hz`, `bin_frequency_hz`,
  `resolution_hz`, `bin_index`, `refined`

Reuses the existing `iqwav.dsp.magnitude_spectrum` FFT utility rather than
duplicating FFT logic; the estimator is a higher-level interpretation layer
over that spectrum.

Behavior:

- Complex IQ input: full two-sided spectrum search, **signed** frequency
  (a tone at `+f` estimates `+f`; a tone at `-f` estimates `-f`).
- Real-valued input: search restricted to the non-negative half of the
  spectrum (spectrum is conjugate-symmetric for real signals), so the
  returned frequency is always **non-negative**; sign is not meaningful
  for a real tone.
- Sub-bin refinement (default on): standard three-point parabolic
  interpolation of the local log-magnitude around the peak bin, using
  circular neighbors since the FFT spectrum is periodic. `refine=False`
  returns the raw FFT bin center with no interpolation.
- Constant/zero-variance input (including all-zero) raises `ValueError`
  rather than fabricating a frequency, since there is no oscillating
  component to localize.
- Requires `fs` positive and finite, and at least 4 samples.

This is explicitly a spectral peak estimator, not a blind RF carrier
estimator: it assumes `fs` is already known and does not attempt occupied
bandwidth, noise-floor/SNR estimation, activity detection, carrier
recovery, CFO correction, timing recovery, baud-rate estimation, or
modulation classification. Those remain later milestones.

### Tests

Added:

- `tests/unit/test_spectral_estimation.py`

Focused estimation tests: `18 passed`.

Complete project test suite: `316 passed` (298 baseline + 18 new, zero
regressions).

Coverage includes signed complex positive/negative-frequency tones, the
real-signal non-negative convention, off-bin tones with refinement shown
to reduce error versus the raw bin, noisy-tone recovery at moderate SNR,
strongest-tone selection among multiple simultaneous tones, and invalid
inputs (bad sample rate, empty/too-few samples, non-finite samples, and
constant/zero signals).

### Next

Per milestone scope, stopping after Phase 2A. Occupied bandwidth, noise
floor, SNR estimation, activity detection, CFO, and other estimation
tasks are deferred to later milestones.

2026-09-01 — Phase 1 correlation primitives implemented and verified

### Implementation

Added reusable finite-length correlation support under:

- `src/iqwav/correlation/core.py`
- `src/iqwav/correlation/__init__.py`

Public functions:

- `autocorrelation(samples)`
- `normalized_autocorrelation(samples)`
- `cross_correlation(first, second)`
- `normalized_cross_correlation(first, second)`
- `find_correlation_peaks(correlation, lags, ...)`

Cross-correlation uses the explicit convention:

`r_xy[lag] = sum_n x[n + lag] * conj(y[n])`

with full finite-length lags ordered from `-(len(y)-1)` through `len(x)-1`.
Consequently, a delayed copy in the first input yields a peak at positive
delay. Normalized variants use the energy of the exact overlapping samples at
each lag and reject whole-input zero-energy cases.

### Tests

Added:

- `tests/unit/test_correlation.py`

Focused correlation tests: `19 passed`.

Complete project test suite: `298 passed`.

Coverage includes known real and complex sequences, documented complex
conjugation behavior, normalization bounds and zero-energy rejection, expected
delayed-copy peak locations, complex-magnitude peak detection, and invalid
array/option inputs.


## 2026-08-30 — Wideband OTA FM channelization and demodulation verified

### Experiment

Extended real-world FM validation using a wideband Mumbai broadcast-FM IQ capture:

- center frequency: 92.3 MHz
- sample rate: 10 MS/s
- file size: approximately 880 MB
- duration: approximately 11 seconds
- format: complex64
- capture contained multiple broadcast-FM stations

The external IQ recording remains under `data/external/` and is not committed to Git.

### Wideband analysis

A wideband PSD covering approximately 87.3–97.3 MHz showed multiple distinct FM broadcast stations.

A strong station around 92.7 MHz was selected for further processing.

### Channelization

The selected station was approximately +400 kHz relative to the 92.3 MHz recording center.

Processing performed:

`wideband IQ`
→ complex-IQ DC removal
→ frequency translation by approximately -400 kHz
→ target station centered near 0 Hz
→ anti-alias filtering and 40× decimation
→ 10 MS/s reduced to 250 kS/s

The resulting PSD confirmed that the selected FM channel remained while neighboring wideband stations were removed.

### FM demodulation

The isolated channel was processed using the production:

`fm_demodulate()`

The demodulated multiplex spectrum showed structure consistent with broadcast FM:

- strong 0–15 kHz program audio,
- clear ~19 kHz stereo pilot,
- energy in the 23–53 kHz stereo-difference region,
- a feature near the ~57 kHz RDS region.

No stereo or RDS decoding was performed.

### Audio recovery

Mono-compatible audio was recovered using:

`FM multiplex`
→ 15 kHz low-pass filtering
→ demodulated DC removal
→ 50 µs FM de-emphasis
→ resampling from 250 kS/s to 50 kS/s
→ normalization
→ 16-bit WAV

The complete capture produced approximately 11 seconds of clear, intelligible broadcast audio.

Processing of the large recording was performed in chunks rather than loading the entire capture into expanded complex arrays.

### Result

PASS — IQWAV successfully processed a genuine wideband multi-station OTA capture, selected and channelized one FM station, demodulated it with the production FM discriminator, identified expected multiplex structure, and recovered clear audio.


## 2026-08-30 — FM demodulation productionized and real-data verified

### Implementation
Added reusable FM phase-discriminator support:

- `src/iqwav/demod/analog.py`
  - `fm_demodulate(samples)`
- exported through `src/iqwav/demod/__init__.py`
- added focused unit tests in:
  - `tests/unit/test_analog_demodulation.py`

The discriminator computes:

`angle(samples[1:] * conj(samples[:-1]))`

and returns phase increment in radians/sample.

It intentionally does not perform:
- `Fs/(2π)` scaling,
- DC removal,
- filtering,
- resampling,
- normalization,
- de-emphasis,
- stereo decoding,
- carrier/CFO estimation.

### Automated verification
- Focused FM-demodulation tests: 11 passed.
- Full project suite: 279 passed.

Tests cover:
- output shape and dtype,
- positive and negative phase increments,
- wrapped phase differences,
- amplitude invariance,
- invalid real/multidimensional input,
- insufficient samples,
- NaN/Inf rejection.

### Real OTA integration verification
The production `fm_demodulate()` function replaced the manual discriminator in:

`notebooks/experiments/02_real_fm_demodulation.ipynb`

Using the genuine 99.5 MHz broadcast-FM IQ recording, the production function successfully produced the same demodulated multiplex spectrum and recovered approximately 4 seconds of clean, clearly intelligible English audio after low-pass filtering and resampling.

### Result
PASS — the reusable FM discriminator is unit-tested, integration-tested and manually verified on genuine OTA IQ data.


## 2026-08-30 — Real OTA IQ smoke test passed

### What was tested
- Downloaded a genuine over-the-air FM IQ recording:
  `fm_rds_250k_1Msamples.iq`
- Known metadata:
  - sample rate: 250 kHz
  - center frequency: 99.5 MHz
  - format: complex64 / interleaved float32 I,Q
  - 1,000,000 complex samples
  - duration: 4 seconds
- Stored locally under:
  `data/external/fm_rds_250k_1Msamples.iq`
  and kept out of Git by `.gitignore`.

### IQWAV path exercised
- `load_raw_iq()`
- `magnitude_spectrum()`
- `welch_psd()`
- `spectrogram_data()`

### Verification
- IQWAV loader matched direct NumPy complex64 loading.
- Time-domain I/Q samples looked physically plausible.
- FFT showed a broad real FM spectrum across the expected ±125 kHz Nyquist span.
- Welch PSD showed consistent occupied spectral structure.
- Waterfall showed time-varying broadband FM energy with sensible frequency/time orientation.
- No obvious corruption, axis error, clipping, or file-format mismatch was observed.

### Result
PASS — current IQWAV raw-IQ ingestion and basic spectral-analysis foundation successfully processed a genuine OTA SDR capture.

### Notes
- Real data is visibly less ideal than synthetic data: asymmetry, spectral bumps, offsets, and time-varying structure are present.
- These effects should not be artificially cleaned up at this stage; future estimators must handle them.
- No FM demodulation or blind parameter estimation was performed in this milestone.



## 2026-08-30 — WAV and Raw IQ File Ingestion Implemented

### Added

Created:

- `src/iqwav/io/wav.py`
- `src/iqwav/io/raw_iq.py`

Implemented:

- `load_wav(path)`
- `load_wav_iq(path, i_channel=0, q_channel=1)`
- `load_raw_iq(path, dtype=np.float32, iq_order="IQ")`

### Capability

IQWAV can now load signal recordings from disk instead of operating only on arrays generated inside Python.

Supported input paths:

- standard WAV files,
- multi-channel WAV interpreted explicitly as I/Q,
- headerless interleaved raw IQ files.

### WAV Behavior

`load_wav`:

- returns WAV sampling rate and samples,
- preserves SciPy-loaded dtype and values,
- supports mono and multi-channel WAV,
- performs no amplitude normalization,
- does not automatically guess I/Q channel meaning.

`load_wav_iq`:

- requires at least two WAV channels,
- explicitly selects I and Q channels,
- combines them as `I + jQ`,
- returns a one-dimensional `complex128` IQ array.

### Raw IQ Behavior

`load_raw_iq`:

- reads headerless raw files with `np.fromfile`,
- supports explicit `"IQ"` or `"QI"` interleaving,
- supports real scalar dtypes such as float32 and int16,
- returns `complex128` IQ samples.

It deliberately does not infer:

- dtype,
- endianness,
- IQ ordering,
- sampling rate,
- center frequency.

These must currently be provided from metadata or operator knowledge.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_io.py`

Current total:

- 268 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- mono WAV round-trip,
- stereo WAV round-trip,
- sampling-rate preservation,
- dtype/value preservation,
- exact WAV I/Q reconstruction,
- alternate channel selection,
- float32 raw IQ reconstruction,
- int16 raw IQ reconstruction,
- QI ordering,
- invalid path/input/channel/order/dtype handling.

### Manual Verification

Created:

`notebooks/learning/03_file_io_and_signal_analysis.ipynb`

Verified the complete path:

`known IQ signal`
→ save as WAV/raw IQ
→ reload from disk
→ reconstruct complex IQ
→ FFT / PSD / spectrogram.

A known 125 Hz complex IQ tone was recovered from both WAV and raw IQ files, and FFT analysis detected the expected 125 Hz spectral peak.

The WAV-loaded and raw-loaded IQ arrays matched each other and matched the original signal within expected floating-point precision.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

`file on disk`
→ WAV/raw IQ ingestion
→ complex NumPy IQ samples
→ FFT
→ PSD
→ spectrogram
→ existing DSP and demodulation utilities.

### Limitation

Raw IQ is headerless, so its representation cannot currently be determined automatically.

### Next

Begin analysis of externally sourced/real IQ recordings rather than only self-generated files.



## 2026-08-30 — Known-Timing BPSK/QPSK Demodulation Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/demod/digital.py`

with:

- `bpsk_demodulate(samples, samples_per_symbol)`
- `qpsk_demodulate(samples, samples_per_symbol)`

### Capability

IQWAV can now perform known-timing hard-decision demodulation for BPSK and QPSK.

Receiver assumptions:

- symbol boundaries are already known,
- no timing recovery,
- no carrier recovery,
- no CFO correction,
- no phase correction.

For each symbol interval, samples are block-averaged and then mapped back to bits using the corresponding decision regions.

### BPSK Decision Rule

- `real(symbol_average) >= 0` → bit `0`
- `real(symbol_average) < 0` → bit `1`

### QPSK Decision Rule

Using the existing Gray mapping:

- `I >= 0, Q >= 0` → `00`
- `I < 0, Q >= 0` → `01`
- `I < 0, Q < 0` → `11`
- `I >= 0, Q < 0` → `10`

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_digital_demodulation.py`

Current total:

- 251 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- clean BPSK round-trip,
- clean QPSK round-trip,
- all four QPSK Gray-mapped quadrants,
- `samples_per_symbol = 1`,
- real BPSK input,
- correct recovered bit counts,
- successful seeded recovery after moderate AWGN,
- invalid input handling.

### Manual Verification

Verified end-to-end synthetic communication chains:

`bits → BPSK waveform → AWGN → BPSK demodulation → recovered bits`

and:

`bits → QPSK waveform → AWGN → QPSK demodulation → recovered bits`

Recovered bits matched the transmitted bits in the controlled notebook test.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

`bits`
→ BPSK/QPSK symbol mapping
→ sampled rectangular waveform
→ AWGN / CFO / phase impairment injection
→ known-timing hard-decision demodulation
→ recovered bits.

### Limitation

The receiver currently assumes perfect symbol timing and does not estimate or correct timing, carrier frequency offset, or phase.

### Next

Add real `.wav` and raw IQ file ingestion before expanding receiver complexity.


## 2026-08-30 — Signal Power and AWGN Utilities Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/dsp/noise.py`

with:

- `signal_power(samples)`
- `add_awgn(samples, snr_db, rng=None)`

### Capability

IQWAV can now:

- compute average signal power using `mean(|x|^2)`,
- add controlled additive white Gaussian noise,
- generate real Gaussian noise for real signals,
- generate circular complex Gaussian noise for IQ signals,
- target a requested SNR in dB,
- reproduce noise deterministically using a seeded NumPy RNG.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_noise.py`

Current total:

- 154 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- known signal powers,
- real and complex noise behavior,
- shape and dtype preservation,
- seeded reproducibility,
- measured SNR near requested values,
- invalid-input handling.

### Manual Verification

Compared clean and noisy IQ signals in the learning notebook.

Verified that:

- the waveform becomes visibly noisy,
- the desired tone remains present,
- the spectrum develops a noise floor around the tone.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

known signal generation
→ controlled noise injection
→ FFT / PSD / spectrogram analysis
→ FIR filtering.

### Next

Continue controlled channel-impairment utilities.


## 2026-08-30 — FIR Filtering Utilities Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/dsp/filters.py`

with:

- `design_lowpass_fir`
- `design_highpass_fir`
- `design_bandpass_fir`
- `apply_fir_filter`

### Capability

IQWAV can now design and apply basic FIR filters for real and complex signals.

Supported filter types:

- low-pass,
- high-pass,
- band-pass.

Filters are designed using `scipy.signal.firwin` and applied using `scipy.signal.lfilter`.

### Validation

Added validation for:

- sampling frequency,
- cutoff frequencies,
- band-pass edge ordering,
- FIR tap count,
- signal shape and finiteness,
- filter-tap shape and finiteness.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_filters.py`

Current total:

- 141 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- valid FIR coefficient generation,
- low-pass behavior,
- high-pass behavior,
- band-pass behavior,
- real and complex signal support,
- output-length preservation,
- invalid-input handling.

### Manual Verification

Created a mixed signal containing low- and high-frequency tones and applied a low-pass FIR filter.

Verified in the spectrum that the low-frequency component remained while the high-frequency component was strongly attenuated.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

known signal generation
→ FFT/PSD/spectrogram analysis
→ basic FIR filtering.

### Next

Continue foundational DSP utilities.


## 2026-08-30 — Spectrogram / Waterfall Data Utility Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/dsp/spectrogram.py`

with:

`spectrogram_data(samples, fs, nperseg=256, noverlap=None)`

### Capability

IQWAV can now compute time-frequency power data for a signal.

The function returns:

- time axis in seconds,
- frequency axis in Hz,
- spectrogram power matrix in linear units.

The frequency axis is arranged as:

negative frequencies → 0 → positive frequencies.

The returned power matrix has shape:

`(number of frequency bins, number of time segments)`

This data will later support the GUI waterfall / spectrogram view required by the SIH problem statement.

### Validation

Added checks for:

- invalid/non-finite sampling frequency,
- non-1-D signals,
- empty signals,
- NaN/Inf samples,
- invalid `nperseg`,
- invalid `noverlap`.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_spectrogram.py`

Current total:

- 108 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- output dimensions,
- increasing time axis,
- centered frequency ordering,
- correct signed frequency detection across time,
- invalid-input handling.

### Manual Verification

Used a stationary `-100 Hz` IQ tone and plotted the returned spectrogram data.

Observed a horizontal power ridge around `-100 Hz` across time, as expected for a constant-frequency signal.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

known tone generation
→ FFT magnitude
→ periodogram PSD
→ Welch PSD
→ spectrogram / waterfall data.

### Next

Continue foundational DSP utilities.


## 2026-08-30 — PSD Utilities Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/dsp/psd.py`

with:

- `periodogram_psd(samples, fs)`
- `welch_psd(samples, fs, nperseg=None)`

### Capability

IQWAV can now estimate power spectral density using:

- a standard periodogram,
- Welch averaged PSD.

Both functions return:

- frequency axis in Hz,
- PSD values in linear units.

Outputs are arranged as:

negative frequencies → 0 → positive frequencies.

### Validation

Added checks for:

- invalid/non-finite sampling frequency,
- non-1-D signals,
- empty signals,
- NaN/Inf samples,
- invalid `nperseg`.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_psd.py`

Current total:

- 89 tests passing.

Tests verify:

- output size,
- centered frequency ordering,
- real-tone symmetric PSD peaks,
- signed complex-IQ peak location,
- default and explicit Welch segment lengths,
- invalid-input handling.

### Manual Verification

Used the learning notebook to compare periodogram and Welch PSD.

Observed:

- periodogram gives a sharper/taller peak for the clean synthetic tone,
- Welch gives a broader/smoother peak due to segment averaging.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

known tone generation
→ FFT magnitude analysis
→ periodogram PSD
→ Welch PSD.

### Next

Continue foundational DSP processing and visualization utilities.


## 2026-08-30 — FFT Magnitude Spectrum Utility Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/dsp/spectrum.py`

with:

`magnitude_spectrum(samples, fs, fftshift=True)`

### Capability

The function:

- accepts real or complex 1-D NumPy signal arrays,
- computes the FFT,
- computes raw FFT magnitude,
- generates the corresponding frequency axis in Hz,
- optionally applies FFT shift so frequency ordering becomes:

negative frequencies → 0 → positive frequencies.

### Validation

Added checks for:

- invalid or non-finite sampling frequency,
- non-1-D input,
- empty arrays,
- NaN or infinite samples.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_spectrum.py`

Current total:

- 66 tests passing.

Spectrum tests verify:

- output length,
- correct frequency-axis construction,
- real-tone peaks at ±f,
- complex IQ tone peak at the correct signed frequency,
- shifted and unshifted FFT ordering,
- invalid input handling.

### Manual Verification

Used:

`notebooks/learning/01_tone_generation.ipynb`

to visually inspect the generated IQ spectrum and confirmed the expected spectral peak location.

### Current Capability

IQWAV now supports:

known synthetic tone generation
→ FFT spectrum analysis
→ frequency-domain verification.

### Next

Continue building foundational DSP analysis utilities.

## 2026-08-29 — Synthetic Tone Generator Implemented

### Added

Created:

`src/iqwav/modulation/tones.py`

with reusable generators for:

- real cosine tones,
- complex IQ tones.

Both support:

- sampling frequency,
- tone frequency,
- duration,
- amplitude,
- phase.

### Validation

Added checks for:

- invalid sampling frequency,
- invalid duration,
- negative amplitude,
- non-finite values,
- Nyquist violations,
- impossible sample counts,
- extreme `fs * duration` overflow.

For complex IQ tones, the exact Nyquist boundary is rejected because positive and negative frequency become indistinguishable there.

### Tests

Added:

`tests/unit/test_tones.py`

Current result:

- 52 tests passing.

Tests cover:

- sample count,
- time spacing,
- data types,
- amplitude,
- phase,
- known sample sequences,
- FFT frequency location,
- positive/negative IQ behavior,
- Nyquist policy,
- invalid inputs.

### Manual Verification

Created:

`notebooks/learning/01_tone_generation.ipynb`

and visually verified:

- real cosine waveform,
- I and Q components,
- circular IQ trajectory,
- opposite rotation for positive and negative IQ frequency.

### Current Capability

IQWAV can now generate deterministic real and complex synthetic tones with known ground-truth parameters for downstream DSP testing.

### Next

Implement reusable FFT/spectrum analysis utilities for known synthetic signals.



## 2026-08-29 — Modules 7–8 Completed and Python Environment Established

### Learning Progress

Completed:

- Module 7 — Digital Communication Fundamentals
- Module 8 — Digital Modulation

Current learning boundary is now Modules 0–8.

Next:

- Module 9 — Correlation & Statistical Signal Analysis

### Development Environment

Created project virtual environment using Python 3.11.

Installed initial dependencies:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- pytest

Configured the project using `pyproject.toml`.

Installed IQWAV in editable development mode using:

`pip install -e .`

Verified that:

`import iqwav`

resolves directly to:

`src/iqwav/`

### New Implementation Boundary

The project may now implement:

- synthetic digital-modulation generators,
- digital signal visualizations,
- constellation handling,
- pulse-shaping experiments,
- controlled demodulation where parameters are known,
- DSP infrastructure supported by Modules 0–8.

Blind-analysis functionality remains deferred until the relevant later modules are completed.

### Next

Create the first production milestone: controlled synthetic-signal and DSP foundation.



## 2026-08-29 — Repository Foundation

### Status

IQWAV project repository initialized.

### Completed

Created the initial directory architecture containing:

- configs
- data
- docs
- gnuradio
- models
- native
- notebooks
- outputs
- scripts
- src
- tests

Created the Python package structure under:

`src/iqwav/`

with initial subsystem directories for:

- io
- dsp
- modulation
- estimation
- synchronization
- amr
- demod
- interleaving
- fec
- correlation
- framing
- pipeline
- ui
- utils

Created:

- README.md
- LOGS.md
- .gitignore
- requirements.txt
- pyproject.toml

Added `.gitkeep` placeholders where required so important empty directories can exist in Git.

Configured `.gitignore` to prevent large/generated/local files from accidentally entering the repository.

Git repository initialized with:

- default branch: `main`

### Current Learning Position

Completed:

Modules 0 through 6.

Latest completed module:

Module 6 — Analog Modulation.

Next learning module:

Module 7 — Digital Communication Fundamentals.

### Current Product Capability

No production DSP processing components have yet been implemented.

The repository currently provides the software/project foundation only.

### Important Decision
